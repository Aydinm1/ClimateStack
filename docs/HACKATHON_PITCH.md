# Hackathon Pitch: City-Scale Microclimate Risk Intelligence

## 60-Second Spoken Pitch

Climate risk is not evenly distributed, even across one city block.  
Right now, most weather alerts are city-wide, but the real danger is hyperlocal, especially for heat stress and low visibility.

We built the Davis Microclimate Safety Network, a real-time system that monitors 60 sensors across 15 intersections and turns raw weather conditions into clear, per-intersection risk scores.

Our backend fuses temperature, humidity, visibility, and atmospheric context, then classifies each location into LOW, MODERATE, HIGH, or EXTREME risk and pushes live alerts over WebSockets.

On top of that, we added a user safety page where someone answers a quick yes/no risk profile, like dehydration sensitivity, and gets personalized guidance: avoid this intersection now and take this safer alternative route instead.

If we had more time, we would connect live city sensor feeds, integrate turn-by-turn navigation, and validate impact with real public-safety pilots.

## Soundbites For Q&A

### What is unique?
We are not just a map and not just a chatbot. We combine live intersection-level risk intelligence with personal vulnerability profiling so guidance is both local and individualized.

### Why now?
Heat waves and low-visibility events are getting more frequent and dangerous, while urban mobility is still guided by coarse forecasts that miss street-level conditions.

### What would you build next?
Connect live city IoT and traffic visibility feeds, route directly into navigation apps, and expand to additional hazards like smoke, flood pooling, and air quality.

## Claims To Keep Accurate In Judging

- This is a working prototype.
- It currently uses simulated sensor data for Davis scenarios.
- The system provides real-time risk scoring, alerts, and personalized guidance in the app.

## Claims To Avoid

- Do not claim production deployment.
- Do not claim measured injury reduction yet.
- Do not claim active city/government partnerships unless asked and verified.
